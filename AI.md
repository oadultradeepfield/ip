# AI Usages

## Increment `A-BetterGui`

ChatGPT assisted in improving the FXML layout by suggesting structural changes (wrapping elements in `VBox`) so that the
profile picture and dialog text could be bottom-aligned within the container, rather than just aligned relative to the
screen. This ensured proper visual alignment for the chat UI.

## Increment `A-UserGuide`

Claude assisted in correcting grammar errors, improving sentence structure, and enhancing markdown formatting for better
readability. This included fixing typos (e.g., "Pre-requisites" to "Prerequisites"), improving punctuation and clarity,
standardizing formatting consistency, and making minor structural adjustments to improve the flow of the user guide
while preserving the original content and meaning.
